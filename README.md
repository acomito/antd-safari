## Getting Started

Same as the regular base project. See https://themeteorchef.com/base/getting-started/

## Changes from ORIGINAL Base - Overall

* added material-ui with `meteor npm install material-ui`
* added `formsy-react` and `formsy-react-material-ui`
* added `react-tap-event-plugin` with `meteor npm install --save react-tap-event-plugin`
* uses formsy instead of jquery and jquery validation



## Other Stuff
* [How to Do a FAB in the corner] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35828991/make-material-ui-reactjs-floatingactionbutton-float)
* [AirBnB Style Guide for React] (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)
* [MaterialUp curates the best of Material Design, daily.] (http://www.materialup.com/)
* [Material Palette] (https://www.materialpalette.com/) 

## TODO
* where applicable, use this.context.muiTheme to reference the global theme object. [See here](http://www.material-ui.com/#/customization/themes)
* Re-add re-routing logic (login, reset, etc. etc.)
* it would be cool to tie bert-alert color schemes into the material-ui color scheme
* where it makes sense, extract inline-js css styles to the .scss files
* Keep an eye out for new version of Material-UI... errors since react updated (https://facebook.github.io/react/warnings/unknown-prop.html)
* improve documentation
* you have to click off the input field for formsy to validate and change the submit button from disabled... minor UI blemish.
* **Consider Other Versions:**
* mobx
* redux
* flux
* relay/graphql
