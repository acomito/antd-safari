## Getting Started

* Fill out the settings-development.json file with your app name, support email and support name.

## Where's the code?

If you haven't seen Meteor 1.3's recommended application structure yet you may be wondering where the actual code is.

Most of the app is in the `imports` folder. The UI is found in `imports/ui`. The API (methods, publications, schemas) can be found in `imports/api`
